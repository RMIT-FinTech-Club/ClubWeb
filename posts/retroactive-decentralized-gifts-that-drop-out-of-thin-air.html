            <h1 id="what-is-retroactive">What is Retroactive?</h1>
<p>Retroactive is an event that gives FREE tokens to <em>early participants</em> who have been supported the project during early days. It usually happens in many AMMs (Automated Market Maker)  or Layer 3 projects.
In order to earn, users have to do some specific actions (bounties) to meet the &#39;requirements&#39; such as making transactions, interacting with features. However, there are cases that users just need to &#39;be there&#39; on day 1  (pics below).</p>

<p>On September 17th, 2020, Uniswap rewarded its users with 400 UNI (~2000$) - igniting the Retroactive movements later on.</p>

<p>Retroactive, or Airdrop - is a wonderful marketing move to attract more users to the projects. It&#39;s also a &#39;thank-you letter&#39; for early contributors to incentivize them (and to HODL).</p>
<p><strong>Airdrop:</strong> is just a synonym of retroactive. There are some distributors who refer to this word as a &quot;planned retroactive&quot; campaign.</p>
<h2 id="wait-what-do-you-mean-by-planned">Wait, what do you mean by &quot;planned&quot;?</h2>
<p>Yep, you heard me right. The majority of happened retroactives haven&#39;t been announced to the community until they actually happen. For investors who are here for a couple of swings, you are exposed to certain risks like losing <strong>your money, and your time</strong> as airdrop is so attractive that it can become <strong>a bait</strong>. </p>

<p>Worry not my dear friends! People always said: &quot;High risk, high return.&quot;</p>
<h1 id="biggest-airdrop-of-incomparable-time-bait">Biggest Airdrop of incomparable time (BAIT)</h1>
<p>dYdX dropped 7.5% of its initial billion-strong token supply on Sept 8. At the current price of $11.12, those 75M tokens are worth more than $800M. At one point the airdropped tokensâ€™ value eclipsed $1B. </p>
