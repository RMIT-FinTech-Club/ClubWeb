            <p>The words AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are commonly used recently whenever people want to prove their innovative idea. Let’s find out their definitions and in-depth analysis of applications they are using nowadays

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> has 2 main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers.</em></li>
<li><em>the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>and <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>...</p>
<ul>
<li><em>enables a system to improve its performance in a given task with more and more experience or data.</em></li>
<li><em>algorithms that learn from examples and experience (data) instead of hard-coded rules.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>AI is the most general term when people are talking about how computers can learn human behavior and act like humans. A truly good AI product can make people confused in judging whether they are interacting with computers or real humans. We can easily come up with an example of <strong>chatbot</strong> or <strong>telephone customer service</strong>, which may have tricked us at the first time if we haven’t been informed it’s programmed to answer.</p>
<p>We can easily make our AI from a bunch of if-else condition statements to create a rule for a response. For example, we are building an AI math tutor that can solve math exercises. If the program sees 2 numbers with a plus sign like “2 + 2”, we can train it to recognize if the user wants to do the addition and return a number in a fancy way like “The answer to your question is 4.”  But if the user asks “Does 2 + 2 = 4”, the answer must be yes or no.  And we need to cover lots of stuff with a change in a single word and update the rules. </p>
<p>From here we can see <strong>hard-coded rules</strong> are not effective and that is why machine learning can help AI solutions be more <strong>adaptive</strong>. We can use the experience (dataset/sample) to make a model which can classify, predict, or figure out the pattern and <strong>can be updated when more receive more data</strong>. Fitting new data into 1 model will be much more scalable than figuring out new rules based on new data. Recently, the process of updating algorithms can be done online and intermediately thanks to <strong>Big Data and Cloud Services</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Deep learning (DL)</strong> is defined as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A machine learning subfield of learning representations of data. Exceptionally effective at learning patterns.</li>
<li>Deep learning algorithms attempt to learn (multiple levels of) representation by using a hierarchy of multiple layers</li>
<li>If you provide the system with tons of information, it begins to understand it and respond in useful ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>For better understanding, DL is <strong>a specific type</strong> of ML that is inspired by the way a human brain filters information. It can perform the more complex tasks, learn and make intelligent decisions on its own, but require massive amounts of data, as well as resources for training (CPU, GPU, time). </p>
<p>Imagine that you provide the input to <strong>a black box</strong>, then it returns the output. The things that happen inside the black box is a complex function that mimics how the human brain learns and is quite hard to explain.</p>
